In the ever-evolving world of SEO, creating content that ranks well and genuinely answers user questions can be challenging. Enter PAA (People Also Ask) content—a revolutionary approach to content creation that leverages Google's understanding of user intent to create comprehensive, SEO-optimized content. In this guide, we'll explore how to create powerful PAA content and how the Onpage.ai Chrome extension can streamline this process.
